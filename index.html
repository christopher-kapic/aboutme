      <h2>Cricky Calculator</h2>
      <p>
        Cricky Calculator was the first project that I really <i>used</i> code
        for. (I had made a Hello World before). The purpose of Cricky Calculator
        is to be a graphing calculator that demonstrates linear transformations
        instead of a traditional R<sup>2</sup> to R<sup>1</sup> function.

      <h2>Cricky Clock</h2>
      <p>
        After making Cricky Calculator, I wanted to try something else. One
        thing that has always annoyed me is when I use a song that I like for my
        alarm and I get tired of hearing it as an alarm, so I lost my enjoyment
        of the song.

      <h2>Rotate.zone</h2>
      <p>
        Rotate.zone was a day project I created to help Fortnite players
        calculate the time it takes to run to the next zone. It uses a voice
        recognition API and a TTS API and acts as a voice assistant. Overall, it
        is not feature rich, but it does work. Try going to the website and
        saying the command "Rotate 500."

      <h2>TickerTab</h2>
      <p>
        TickerTab is a project that I am currently working on. It is an options
        pricing calculator that uses a prediction for the underlying stock to
        determine the price of an option. As of now, I only have a simple
        prototype, but it is something that I plan on improving throughout the
        summer.
